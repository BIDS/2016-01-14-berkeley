Assertions are the simplest type of test. They are used as a tool for bounding 
acceptable behavior during runtime. The assert keyword in python has the 
following behavior:

~~~ {.python}
>>> assert True == False
~~~
~~~ {.output}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  AssertionError
~~~
~~~ {.python}
  >>> assert True == True
~~~
~~~ {.output}
  >>>
~~~

That is, assertions halt code execution instantly if the comparison is false. 
It does nothing at all if the comparison is true. These are therefore a very 
good tool for guarding the function against foolish (e.g. human) input:

~~~ {.python}
def mean(num_list):
    assert len(num_list) != 0
    return sum(num_list)/len(num_list)
~~~

The advantage of assertions is their ease of use. They are rarely more than one
line of code. The disadvantage is that assertions halt execution
indiscriminately and the helpfulness of the resulting error message is usually
quite limited. 

Also, input checking may require decending a rabbit hole of exceptional cases. 
What happens when the input provided to the mean function is a string, rather 
than a list of numbers?

Assertions are also helpful for catching abnormal behaviors, such as those that 
arise with floating point arithmetic.

To help with situations such as those above, there are classes of more helpful
assertions that we will use often in later parts of this testing lesson as the
building blocks of our tests. The nose testing package contains many of them.

### Nose

The nose testing framework has built-in assertion types implementing
`assert_almost_equal`, `assert_true`, `assert_false`, `assert_raises`,
`assert_is_instance`, and others.

~~~ {.python}
from nose.tools import assert_almost_equal
from mynum import a
assert_almost_equal(a, 2, places=2)
assert_almost_equal(a, 2, delta=0.003)
~~~

These assertions give much more helpful error messages and have much more 
powerful features than the simple assert keyword. An even more powerful sibling 
of the assertion is the _exception_. We'll learn about those in the next 
lesson.
