Unit tests are so called because they exercise the functionality of the code by
interrogating individual functions and methods. Fuctions and methods can often
be considered the atomic units of software because they are indivisble.
However, what is considered to be the smallest code _unit_ is subjective. The
body of a function can be long are short, and shorter functions are arguably
more unit-like than long ones.

Thus what reasonably constitutes a code unit typically varies from project to
project and language to language.  A good guideline is that if the code cannot
be made any simpler logically (you cannot split apart the addition operator) or
practically (a function is self-contained and well defined), then it is a unit.

The desire to unit test code often has the effect of encouraging both the
code and the tests to be as small, well-defined, and modular as possible.  
In Python, unit tests typically take the form of test functions that call and make
assertions about methods and functions in the code base.  To run these test
functions, a test framework is often required to collect them together. For
now, we'll write some tests for the mean function and simply run them
individually to see whether they fail. In the next session, we'll use a test
framework to collect and run them.

## Unit Tests Are Just Functions

Unit tests are typically made of three pieces, some set-up, a number of
assertions, and some tear-down. Set-up can be as simple as initializing the
input values or as complex as creating and initializing concrete instances of a
class. Ultimately, the test occurs when an assertion is made, comparing the
observed and expected values. For example, let us test that our mean function 
successfully calculates the known value for a simple list.

~~~ {.python}
from mean import *

def test_ints():
    num_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    obs = mean(num_list)
    exp = 3
    assert obs == exp
~~~ 

The test above: 
- sets up the input parameters (the simple list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
- collects the observed result
- declares the expected result (calculated with our human brain).
- and compares the two with an assertion.

A unit test suite is made up of many tests just like this one. A single 
implemented function may be tested in numerous ways.

Well, **that** was tedious.
