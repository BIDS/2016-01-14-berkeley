To make running the tests as easy as possible, many software development teams
implement a strategy called **continuous integration**.
As its name implies, continuous integration integrates the test suite into the
development process. Every time a change is made to the repository, the
continuous integration system builds and checks that code.

 machine until you try rebuilding it on their machine. 

The typical story in a research lab is that, well, you don't know whether it
will work on your colleagues' machine until you try rebuilding it on their
machine. If you have a build system, it might take a few minutes to update the
repository, rebuild the code, and run the tests. If you don't have a build
system, it could take all afternoon just to see if your new changes are
compatible.

Since the first step the server conducts is to check out the code from a 
repository, we'll need to put our code online to make use of this kind of 
server (unless we are able/willing to set up our own CI server).

> ## Set Up a Mean Git Repository on GitHub {.challenge}
> Your `mean.py` `test_mean.py` files can be the contents of a repository on 
> GitHub.
>
> 1. Go to GitHub and [create a repository](https://github.com/new) called 
> mean.
> 2. Clone that repository (git clone https://github.com:yourusername/mean)
> 3. Copy the `mean.py` and `test_mean.py` files into the repository directory.
> 4. Use git to `add`, `commit`, and `push` the two files to GitHub.

## Giving Instructions

Your work on the mean function has both code and tests. Let's copy that code 
into its own repository and add continuous integration to that repository. 

> ## Decide How To Set Up the Server {.challenge}
> It doesn't need a build system, because Python does not
> need to be compiled. 
>
> 1. What does it need?
> 2. Write the names of the software dependencies in a file called
> requirements.txt and save the file.
> 3. In fact, why don't you go ahead and version control it?


### Travis-CI

[Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) is a continous integration server hosting platform. It's commonly used
in Ruby development circles as well as in the scientific python community. 

> ## Get a Travis-CI Account
> To use Travis, all you need is an account. It's free.
> 
> 1. Someone in your group should sign up for a Travis account.
> 2. Follow the instructions on the Travis website to connect your Travis account with GitHub.

A file called `.travis.yml` in your repository will signal to Travis that you want to build and test this repository on Travis-CI. Such a file, for our purposes, is very simple:

~~~
language: python
python:
  - "2.6"
  - "2.7"
  - "3.2"
  - "3.3"
  - "3.4"
  - "nightly"
# command to install dependencies
install:
  - "pip install -r requirements.txt"
# command to run tests
script: nosetests
~~~

You can see how the python package manager, pip, will use your requirements.txt file 
from the previous exercise. That requirements.txt file is a conventional way to 
list all of the python packages that we need. If we needed nose, numpy, and 
pymol, the requirements.txt file would look like this:

~~~
nose
numpy
pymol
~~~

> ## Add a .travis.yml file {.challenge}
> 
> 1. Add .travis.yml to your repository
> 2. Commit and push it.
> 3. Check the situation at [your server](https://travis-ci.org/)


## Continuous Integration Hosting

We gave the example of Travis because it's very very simple to spin up. While
it is able to run many flavors of Linux, it currently doesn't support other
platforms as well. Depending on your needs, you may consider other services
such as:

= [buildbot](http://buildbot.net/)
- [CDash](http://www.cdash.org/)
- [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/)

> ## Key Points {.keypoints}
>
> -   Servers exist for automatically running your tests
> -   Running the tests can be triggered by a GitHub pull request
> -   CI allows cross platform build testing
> -   A .travis.yml file configures a build on the travis-ci servers
> -   Many free CI servers are available
